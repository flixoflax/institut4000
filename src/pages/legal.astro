        <h4>1.2 Data recording on this website</h4>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Who is the responsible party for the recording of data on this
            website (i.e., the “controller”)?</strong
          ><br />
          The data on this website is processed by the operator of the website, whose
          contact information is available under section “Information about the responsible
          party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR)” in this Privacy Policy.

          I collect your data as a result of your sharing of your data with me. This
          may, for instance, be information you enter into my contact form. Other
          data shall be recorded by my IT systems automatically or after you consent
          to its recording during your website visit. This data comprises primarily
          technical information (e.g., web browser, operating system, or time the
          site was accessed). This information is recorded automatically when you
          access this website.
        </p>

        <p>

          ><br />
          You have the right to receive information about the source, recipients,
          and purposes of your archived personal data at any time without having
          to pay a fee for such disclosures. You also have the right to demand that
          your data are rectified or eradicated. If you have consented to data processing,

        <h3>2. Hosting and Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h3>
        <p>
          Vercel is hosting the content of this website at the following
          provider:
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>2.1 Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h4><br />
          The provider is the Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 Avenue John F. Kennedy,
          1855 Luxembourg (hereinafter referred to as “AWS”). When you visit my website,
          your personal data will be processed on AWS servers. This may also result
          in the transfer of personal data to the parent company of AWS in the United
          States. The transfer of data to the US is based on the EU’s standard contractual
          clauses. For details please see the <a
            href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-gdpr/AWS_GDPR_DPA.pdf"

        </p>
        <p>
          AWS is used on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. I have a legitimate
          interest in a depiction of my website that is as reliable as possible.
          If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried
          out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG,
          insofar the consent includes the storage of cookies or the access to
          information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting)
          within the meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Processing</strong><br />
          I have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) with the above-mentioned
          provider. This is a contract mandated by data privacy laws that guarantees
          that they process personal data of my website visitors only based on my
          instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.
        </p>

        <p>

          is Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855, Luxembourg
          (hereinafter referred to as “Amazon”).
        </p>
        <p>
          Amazon CloudFront CDN is a globally distributed Content Delivery
          Network. During these transactions, the information transfer between
          your browser and my website is technically routed via the Content
          Delivery Network. This enables me to boost the global availability and
          performance capabilities of this website. The use of Amazon CloudFront
          CDN is based on my legitimate interest in keeping the presentation of
          my web services as error-free and secure as possible (Art. 6(1)(f)
          GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          The data transfer to the United States is based on the Standard
          Contract Clauses of the EU Commission. You can find the details <a

          <strong>Data Processing</strong><br />
          I have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) with the above-mentioned
          provider. This is a contract mandated by data privacy laws that guarantees
          that they process personal data of my website visitors only based on my
          instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.
        </p>
        <h3>3. General information and mandatory information</h3>
        <h4>Data protection</h4>
        <p>
          The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of
          your personal data very seriously. Hence, I handle your personal data
          as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
          protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will
          be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to
          personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains
          which data I collect as well as the purposes I use this data for. It
          also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.
        </p>
        <p>
          I herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet
          (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps.
          It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party
          access.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Information about the responsible party (referred to as the
          “controller” in the GDPR)
        </h4>
        <p>
          The data processing controller on this website is:<br />
          Niels Clormann<br />
          Wadzeckstraße 4<br />
          10178 Berlin<br />
          E-mail: contact@institut4000.io
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
          single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
          purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.,
          names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
        </p>

        <h4>Storage duration</h4>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this
          privacy policy, your personal data will remain with me until the
          purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a
          justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
          processing, your data will be deleted, unless I have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
          commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
          will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>

        <h4>
          General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this
          website
        </h4>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, I process your personal data
          on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special
          categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the
          case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third
          countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR.
          If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to
          information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the
          data processing is additionally based on § 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent
          can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the
          fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
          measures, I process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
          Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal
          obligation, I process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
          Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of my
          legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the
          relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the
          following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries
        </h4>
        <p>
          Among other things, I use tools of companies domiciled in the United
          States or other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU
          countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may
          potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
          processed there. I must point out that in these countries, a data
          protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be
          guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to
          release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data
          subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in
          court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
          Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
          personal data for surveillance purposes. I have no control over these
          processing activities.
        </p>

        <h4>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h4>
        <p>
          A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
          to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
          you have already given me. This shall be without prejudice to the
          lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
          revocation.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
          object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h4>
        <p>
          IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR
          (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
          OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
          SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
          PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
          DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
          LOG AN OBJECTION, I WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
          DATA, UNLESS I AM IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
          WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
          INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
          THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
          PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
          IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
          ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
          AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY
          TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS
          AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
          DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
          PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
        </p>

        <h4>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h4>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
          log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
          state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
          the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
          complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
          proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>

        <h4>Right to data portability</h4>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand that I hand over any data I automatically
          process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract
          be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used,
          machine-readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of
          the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is
          technically feasible.
        </p>

        <h4>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h4>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
          right to at any time demand information about your archived personal
          data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
          processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
          rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
          matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
          hesitate to contact me at any time.
        </p>

        <h4>Right to demand processing restrictions</h4>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
          the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
          contact me at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
          applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
          archived by me, I will usually need some time to verify this claim.
          During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
          to demand that I restrict the processing of your personal data. If the
          processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful
          manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the
          processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this
          data. If I do not need your personal data any longer and you need it
          to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
          demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
          of its eradication. If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art.
          21(1) GDPR, your rights and my rights will have to be weighed against
          each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests
          prevail, you have the right to demand a restriction of the processing
          of your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
          data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only
          subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
          entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or
          legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the
          European Union or a member state of the EU.
        </p>

        <h4>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h4>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to me as the
          website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
          program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
          the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://”
          and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to me
          cannot be read by third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Recording of data on this website</h3>
        <h4>Server log files</h4>
        <p>
          The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and
          stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser
          communicates to me automatically. The information comprises:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
          <li>The used operating system</li>
          <li>Referrer URL</li>
          <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
          <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
          <li>The IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
        <p>
          This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator
          of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free
          depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In order to
          achieve this, server log files must be recorded.
        </p>

        <h4>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h4>
        <p>
          If you contact me by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including
          all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and
          processed by me for the purpose of processing your request. I do not
          pass these data on without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
          inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for
          the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
          data are processed on the basis of my legitimate interest in the
          effective handling of inquiries submitted to me (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or
          on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been
          obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.

          The data sent by you to me via contact requests remain with me until
          you request me to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
          purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your
          request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory
          retention periods - remain unaffected.
